With the Internet traffic volume increasing rapidly and its performance more dynamic and unpredictable, real time network states have become critical for many of today's distributed systems and applications. The goal of real time measurement for Internet, though simple to state, has been tantalizingly out of reach despite of many previous attempt (iPlane/knowldge plane). It is challenging for existing methods to achieve all three of high coverage, measurement overhead and simulteneous view. In this paper, we observe a never-before-seen opportunity to address all these requirement. The key enabler is Internet video as it dominates the Internet and has become the ``background'' traffic on every major links. By measuring from video players, we will be able to collect simulteneous view of the Internet with an unprecedent high coverage. This paper outlines the vision of real-time measurement with video as a carrier and early feasible solutions to address the challenges arised from this approach.
