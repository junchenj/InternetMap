\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

 Our vision here is a real-time traffic map for the Internet that different
applications query for different path properties and use them to inform their
decisions (e.g., server or peer selection). The key enabler here is the growth
of Internet video and the deployment of measurement instrumentation as part of
the video player logic that can address key issues w.r.t\ coverage, real-time
updates, and the ability to measure bandwidth with close-to-zero overhead. That
said, the inability to collect fine-grained and adaptive measurements introduce
challenges in translating the potential of using video-based measurements.
Fortunately, we show that we can compensate for this lack of  instrumentation
by correlating coarse views collected from multiple diverse vantage points to
identify bottleneck links in the network.
